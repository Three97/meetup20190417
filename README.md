# Create and deploy your own website on a custom domain - Part 1 of 2

## Details
This will take place over 2 meetings, April 17th and May 15th.

You will end up with a custom domain serving your own HTML, CSS and JS. You will learn about things like domain registration, DNS and static site generation. This is a developer centric talk. Specifically, you will learn about hosting static content on GitHub pages. I will focus on the Wyam tool as a way to statically generate content. It is a .NET Core based static site generator that uses Razor syntax. We will also take a look at combining static site generation with other techniques like VueJS and Azure Functions.

For the first session you will need:
- Git installed
- GitHub account
- Text editor of your choice, I will demo using VS Code

For the second session you will need:
- A domain that you have purchased.
- The ability to configure DNS for that domain.
- I will demonstrate using namecheap.com

You will also learn about the general overall benefits of statically generated sites. You will learn about the portability of static content to other services such as AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Netlify and other hosting providers. You will also learn about the performance and architecture benefits of statically generated content.
